    <p>A soft drink (see ยง Terminology for other names) is a drink that usually contains water (often carbonated), a
        sweetener, and a natural and/or artificial flavoring. The sweetener may be a sugar, high-fructose corn syrup,
        fruit juice, a sugar substitute (in the case of diet drinks), or some combination of these. Soft drinks may also
        contain caffeine, colorings, preservatives, and/or other ingredients.

        Soft drinks are called "soft" in contrast with "hard" alcoholic drinks. Small amounts of alcohol may be present
        in a soft drink, but the alcohol content must be less than 0.5% of the total volume of the drink in many
        countries and localities[1][2] if the drink is to be considered non-alcoholic.[3] Fruit punch, tea (even
        kombucha), and other such non-alcoholic drinks are technically soft drinks by this definition, but are not
        generally referred to as such.

        Soft drinks may be served cold, over ice cubes, or at room temperature. They are available in many container
        formats, including cans, glass bottles, and plastic bottles. Containers come in a variety of sizes, ranging from
        small bottles to large multi-liter containers. Soft drinks are widely available at fast food restaurants, movie
        theaters, convenience stores, casual-dining restaurants, dedicated soda stores, vending machines, and bars from
        soda fountain machines. Soft drinks are usually served in paper or plastic disposable cups in the first three
        venues. In casual dining restaurants and bars, soft drinks are often served in glasses made from glass or
        plastic. Soft drinks may be drunk with straws or sipped directly from the cups.

        Soft drinks are mixed with other ingredients in several contexts. In Western countries, in bars and other places
        where alcohol is served (e.g. airplanes, restaurants and nightclubs), many mixed drinks are made by blending a
        soft drink with hard liquor and serving the drink over ice. One well-known example is the rum and coke, which
        may also contain lime juice. Some homemade fruit punch recipes, which may or may not contain alcohol, contain a
        mixture of various fruit juices and a soft drink (e.g. ginger ale). At ice cream parlors and 1950s-themed
        diners, ice cream floats consisting of a soft drink poured over ice cream, such as root beer floats, are often
        sold. Some types of soft drinks are lemon-lime drinks, orange soda, cola, grape soda, and root beer.

        Within a decade of the invention of carbonated water by Joseph Priestley in 1767 inventors in Britain and in
        Europe had used his concept to produce the drink in greater quantities, with one such inventor, J. J. Schweppe,
        forming Schweppes in 1783 and selling the world's first bottled soft drink.[4][5] Soft drink brands founded in
        the 19th century include R. White's Lemonade in 1845 and Coca-Cola in 1886. Subsequent brands include Pepsi,
        Irn-Bru, Sprite, Fanta, Dr Pepper and 7 UP.</p>
