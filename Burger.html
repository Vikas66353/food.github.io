    <p>A hamburger (or burger for short) is a food, typically considered a sandwich, consisting of one or more cooked
        patties—usually ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be pan
        fried, grilled, smoked or flame broiled. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion,
        pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce", often
        a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped with
        cheese is called a cheeseburger.[1]

        The term burger can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the United Kingdom, where the
        term patty is rarely used, or the term can even refer simply to ground beef. Since the term hamburger usually
        implies beef, for clarity burger may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in beef
        burger, turkey burger, bison burger, portobello burger, or veggie burger.

        Hamburgers are typically sold at fast-food restaurants, diners, and specialty and high-end restaurants. There
        are many international and regional variations of hamburgers.</p>
