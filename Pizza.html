  <p>Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is an Italian dish consisting of a usually round, flattened base
    of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies,
    mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a
    wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

    In Italy, pizza served in formal settings, such as at a restaurant, is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use
    of a knife and fork.[2][3] In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.

    The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta
    in Lazio, on the border with Campania.[4] Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have
    since become popular in many countries.[5] It has become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common
    fast food item in Europe, North America and Australasia; available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza),
    restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, and via pizza delivery.[5][6] Various food companies also sell
    ready-baked frozen pizzas in grocery stores, to be reheated in an ordinary home oven.

    The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (lit. True Neapolitan Pizza Association) is a non-profit organization
    founded in 1984 with headquarters in Naples that aims to promote traditional Neapolitan pizza.[7] In 2009, upon
    Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed
    dish,[8][9] and in 2017 the art of its making was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.</p>
